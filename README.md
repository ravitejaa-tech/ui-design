#Install the Ionic CLI

Before proceeding, make sure the latest version of Node.js and npm are installed. See Environment Setup for details. Install the Ionic CLI globally with npm:

npm install -g ionic

#Start an App
Create an Ionic app using one of the pre-made app templates, or a blank one to start fresh. The three most common starters are the blank starter, tabs starter, and sidemenu starter. Get started with the ionic start command:

Ionic start myApp tabs

#Run the App
The majority of Ionic app development can be spent right in the browser using the ionic serve command:

cd myApp
ionic serve
